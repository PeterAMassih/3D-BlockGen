# 3D-BlockGen
This project explores the use of diffusion models to automatically generate 3D building block designs, such as LEGO®️, conditioned on textual descriptions or images. Traditional tools for creating 3D bricks models are manual and time-consuming, and this project aims to automate the process by leveraging deep learning generative models.
